08/03/2024 - Abbey made it to California with me. She's sick which was expected. She's sneezing blood, but recovering.

08/08/2024- a pod of dolphins swam by while surfing, ran a 10k, and fetched Parabola, which is the most decadent aperitif I've had. Although different than a costly pinot from Napier - Parabola has a far more complex profile. Made another five thousand.

08/09/2024 - Long day getting life back in order - So decided to do a sunrise run along PCH. Mellow glassy waves crashed into the shoreline. Made it to Terra Mar where there were small but surfable crumbling waves.

Put this song on, and I thought about you...I wonder if you get it too...

"Tell me what you thought about when you were gone and so alone

The worst is over

You can have the best of me

We got older, but we're still young

We never grew out of this feeling that we won't give up"
